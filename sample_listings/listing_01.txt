Stellar Rewards Platinum by NovaBank is a credit card that helps you earn money back every time you spend. If you’re not familiar with credit cards, here’s how it works: you get 2% cashback on everything you buy, which means for every £100 you spend, you get £2 back. For the first 12 months, you won’t pay any interest on your purchases (this is called a 0% introductory APR). After that, the interest rate is 18.9% (variable), which means it can change. There’s an annual fee of £95, and if you pay late, the fee can be up to £12. This card is best for people with a good to excellent credit score (881-999). You don’t pay extra when you use your card abroad. All the fees and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what you’re signing up for. You can apply online, and NovaBank will let you know quickly if you’re approved. Using a card like this responsibly can help you build your credit history and earn rewards at the same time.
