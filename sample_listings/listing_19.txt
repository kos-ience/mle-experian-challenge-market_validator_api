Summit Silver from Zenith Bank is a credit card designed to help you manage your spending while earning rewards. If you’re new to credit cards, here’s what you need to know: with Summit Silver, you pay no interest on purchases for the first 12 months (this is called a 0% introductory APR). After that, the interest rate becomes 20.1% (variable), which means it can change over time. There’s an annual fee of £45, but you won’t be charged a fee if you miss a payment. For every purchase you make, you’ll get 1.2% cashback, which means a small amount of money is returned to you based on what you spend. This card is best for people who have a good credit score (800 or above). All the costs and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what to expect. You can apply online, and the bank will let you know quickly if you’re approved. Remember, having a good credit score helps you qualify for better cards and rates in the future.
