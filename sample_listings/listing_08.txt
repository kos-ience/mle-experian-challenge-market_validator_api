Zenith Bank | Summit Gold

Summit Gold from Zenith Bank is a credit card that helps you manage your money with a long interest-free period. For the first 18 months, you won’t pay any interest on your purchases (0% APR). After that, the interest rate is 19.5% (variable), which means it can change. There’s an annual fee of £60, which you pay each year to use the card. This card is for people with a good credit score (800 or above). All the fees and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what to expect. You can apply online, and Zenith Bank will let you know quickly if you’re approved. Using this card responsibly can help you build your credit and enjoy extra flexibility with your spending.
