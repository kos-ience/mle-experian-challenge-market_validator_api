Card Name: Summit Gold by Zenith Bank

Brief Description:
Summit Gold by Zenith Bank is a credit card that gives you extra time to pay off your purchases without interest. For the first 18 months, you won’t pay any interest on what you buy (this is called a 0% introductory APR). After that, the interest rate is 19.5% (variable), which means it can change. There’s an annual fee of £60, which is the amount you pay each year to use the card. This card is for people with a good credit score (800 or above). The long introductory period helps you manage your money, and all the fees and requirements are explained clearly so you know what to expect. You can apply online, and Zenith Bank will let you know if you’re approved. Using this card responsibly can help you build your credit and enjoy extra flexibility with your spending.
